## Airbnb Clone 

This is the first phase in developing a clone of the well-known AirBnB website. This part of the project focuses on constructing the backend of the full web application, focusing on select features for this initial phase. The project is structured in a way that links multiple concepts using python OOP programming as the main construct and storing the generated data into a Json file.


## Usage

The following actions are made possible by the integrated flow from backend to storage operation:
- Creating a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
- Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Updating attributes of an object
- Destroying an object
